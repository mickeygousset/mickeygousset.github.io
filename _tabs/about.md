I'm a DevOps Architect on the GitHub FastTrack team.  That means my day job is going out and helping people get more "devopsy", usually with a focus on GitHub, DevOps, and AI.

I also am a content creator, creating content on my [blog](https://mickeygousset.com/), [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/mickeygousset), and [YouTube](https://youtube.com/mickeygousset).   Most of my content revolves around DevOps, GitHub, and AI, as you might expect.

Check out my organization, https://github.com/mickeygoussetorg, to see all my demo repos and other fun stuff I'm working on.  After all, everyone needs a [GitHub Action to tell a Dad Joke](https://github.com/mickeygoussetorg/get-a-dad-joke), right?

And don't be a stranger! There are all sorts of ways to interact with me, from leaving comments on my posts to various social media options. Reach out! I'd love to hear from you!
